The Ashram is located in the eastern part of Pondicherry. Inmates live and work 
in a number of buildings spread throughout the area. The focus of community life 
is the Ashram main building, usually called simply "the Ashram", which consists of an
 interconnected block of houses, including those in which Sri Aurobindo and the Mother 
lived for most of their lives. At its centre, in a tree-shaded courtyard, lies the Samadhi,
 a white marble shrine where their bodies are laid to rest.
