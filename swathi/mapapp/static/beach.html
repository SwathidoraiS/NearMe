Pondy Marina Beach in Pondicherry is the new tourist attraction near the new lighthouse.
 It was developed under the theme-based beaches programs by the Pondicherry government,
 and “Pondy Marina” beach is based on a food-based theme.They offer horse and camel riding
 on sandy beaches and ATV rides for adventure seekers. They have an adventure activity zone
 behind the food court, where many rides are there for kids and adults alike. They have a big
 open lawn to conduct parties and conferences. Having a party next to the beach with all the facilities will be fun.
