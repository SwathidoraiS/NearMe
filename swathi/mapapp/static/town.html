Known as the French Colony of Pondicherry, White Town is a residential area in town
 which boasts of an interwoven culture of the Tamils and the primal French families.
  Flaunting cobblestone streets and mustard yellow houses, the colony retains the old 
  world charm, daintiness and also the architecture of ancient French Quarters. Most of these
   have been converted into heritage hotels, restaurants, quirky cafes and art galleries. The
    buildings are mostly painted in pale yellow colour or shades of it and the well paved clean pathways 
    are lined with shady trees.
Known to be the former headquarters of the French, White Town is borrows a lot from the foreign 
culture, which is also the highlight of the place. In addition to that, it is known for its elegant but expensive
 market which mostly comprises of boutiques, high-end brands and personalized goodsâ€™ stores. Most of these stores 
 are still run by French nationalists. Besides, you can also find home decor and antique furniture shops here.
