The Botanical Garden was established by the French in 1826, 
however mention of it has been made in 1740 itself. The main
 purpose of the Botanical Garden at that time was to study the
 performance of various cultivable plants and to identify suitable
 plants based on their adoptability to the agro-climatic conditions 
of Puducherry. In the year 1829 a vast collection of eight to nine hundred 
species were grown in an area of 7500 square meters was reported by the famous traveler Victor Jacquemont.
